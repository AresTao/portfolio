Welcome behind the curtain of my personal portfolio. Take a look around.

This website is build using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) (React Framework), [Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com) (Component Library) and [Airtable](https://airtable.com/invite/r/HsvqbADg) / Notion as backend. 

## Get it running locally

To get this website running locally, type this into your terminal:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/AresTao/portfolio
$ cd portfolio
$ yarn
$ yarn dev
```

Make sure to add environmental variables, if you want to play around with the [Airtable](https://airtable.com/invite/r/lZRqLnNl) . To do so create a `.env.local` file similar to [`.env.example`](https://github.com/AresTao/portfolio/blob/master/.env.example).
